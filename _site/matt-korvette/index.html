        <p><b>What attracts you to writing songs about loners?</b></p>

<p>I don&#39;t particularly try to write about loners, I generally write about things that affect me personally and privately. Some of the thoughts I have when alone are pretty relatable.</p>

<p><b>Do you often encounter expectations about the band that you fail to meet?</b></p>

<p>I have never pissed my jeans on stage, and I am pretty sure that has left a few people disappointed. They need to get over it.</p>

<p><b>What&#39;s the relationship between punk and Pissed Jeans?</b></p>

<p>I like to think that I live my life how I want, and don&#39;t just fall into some pre-programmed stereotype, but at the same time, I&#39;m a pretty normal person. We all came from the loud &amp; fast rules dictum of hardcore punk. Recently we played a show with Negative Approach. They were raw and great. Just as I hoped.</p>

<p><b>What&#39;s the worst show you&#39;ve ever played?</b></p>

<p>We played in Columbus, Ohio to a small disinterested crowd on the night of a big Ohio State football game and it stunk. Even that wasn&#39;t so bad, really.</p>

<p><b>Was it pretty important to you to get a lot of girls in your new video?</b></p>

<p>Women dancing with the band was basically the central theme, so yes. I definitely want to make Pissed Jeans a thing that women can enjoy, since they are undeniably the superior gender.</p>

<p><b>How do you see the future for Pissed Jeans?</b></p>

<p>Have fun, be cool, enjoy life, that&#39;s it really. Pissed Jeans are already far more successful than I could&#39;ve ever hoped. I don&#39;t see it changing drastically, but I hope we do continue to change and evolve. I think it&#39;s safe to say we will always be pretty loud and rocking.</p>
