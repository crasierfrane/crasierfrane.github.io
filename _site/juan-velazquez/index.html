        <p><b>How&#39;s tour going?</b></p>

<p>Tour&#39;s been cool. It&#39;s been long. This is our first show after a bunch of shows with No Age which was really cool. It was just a really great time with close friends. Seeing them every night was really inspiring. We went to Europe, deep Europe like Slovenia and Croatia. It was really cool to be in those places. Every day felt drastically new and exciting. It feels like a weird privilege to be able to go that far out and be able to do something as simple as play a show. It felt good. I&#39;m the only member of my family to ever go to those places, like some weird ambassador.</p>

<p><b>What&#39;s the history of Abe Vigoda?</b></p>

<p>Me and Juan started playing music together in 2002. We were both in high school, close friends with nothing better to do, kinda like how anybody else starts. We always kept on playing together. We were doing this thing as a two piece but never really went anywhere with it. Then we decided we wanted to start a full band with drums, do the real thing. When we first started it was a kinda dance punk sound Ã  la the Rapture, or Moving Units. I was like 15. As we got older, the sound grew from this no-wavey thing and increasingly got more melodic and I would say poppy. I don&#39;t use that term in a bad way, I really think it&#39;s great. We&#39;ve always been progressing and trying to pursue this project more and more heavily. Whenever we write some new material we&#39;re always trying to think progressively about what would be challenging for us and maybe for our audience. A lot of hard work, DIY, touring, and really just putting yourself out there. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing for this past 5 years.</p>

<p><b>Do you feel like moving to Los Angeles gave you access to a particular creative community?</b></p>

<p>Definitely. Especially with all the DIY venues there. <a href=http://www.thesmell.org/>The Smell</a> was the first place that exposed me to different ways of thinking in a broader sense. Not just music, aesthetics. A way to approach something. You can just do it, really go for it. Other ones that are less recognised too, like <a href=http://www.myspace.com/pehrspace>Pehrspace</a>. It spans the gamut. Visual art, film, there&#39;s just so many artists in Los Angeles working at it and taking it really seriously. I feel honoured to call some of those people friends. It&#39;s always inspiring. I feel lucky to live in Los Angeles, it&#39;s unlike any other place that I&#39;ve been to. But I feel like those kind of people and that kind of drive can be found in any city if you look hard enough.</p>

<p><b>Tell me a bit about making the new album.</b></p>

<p>Well we started writing the new songs at the beginning of 2009. This is the first material we&#39;ve written with our new drummer. We did a lot of touring in 2009 as well. Then in the beginning of 2010 we met up with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Coady>Chris Coady</a>. He&#39;s an amazing producer/engineer. He&#39;s worked on a tonne of shit that I really love, like the new Beach House record, weird TV on the Radio engineering stuff. He really knows his shit and did a great job. He was just into the project and wanted to work with us, and I felt really fortunate to work with him. It was really a cool experience. We&#39;ve never focused so much on a record in terms of recording so things came out that wouldn&#39;t have if we didn&#39;t work with him or weren&#39;t working at the studio we were working at, <a href=http://infrasonicsound.com/>Infrasonic Studios</a> in LA.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really happy with the end result. I&#39;m really proud of it. Some people seem to think it&#39;s not for them, but then other people seem to think this is the first record of ours they can really get into. I think that polarising of audiences is really critical to me as an artist. I&#39;m into fucking with people in that way. It&#39;s funner. I definitely think it&#39;s important to me. I think it&#39;d be redundant to do the same thing or make the same record twice. I understand we might be losing some fans or maybe gaining some, but it doesn&#39;t really matter to me. It&#39;s always just been an honest expression of what us four are doing or going through at that time. It&#39;s definitely how it has happened, but I guess you could say it kind of is a goal too. I think the music we&#39;re writing now feels more honest than anything we&#39;ve written before.</p>

<p><b>Do you feel like there&#39;s a particular legacy in Californian music that you guys tap into?</b></p>

<p>I&#39;m really inspired by the Minutemen. As far as three really regular dudes, who don&#39;t conform to the idea of punk as power chords, doing something weirder and a little funky. I&#39;m into that, but so much LA punk to me is generic. I love Black Flag and stuff, but it has this legacy, especially in the late 90s and into the 2000s which is really just disgusting. I can&#39;t stand it. I&#39;m grateful that it&#39;s opened certain windows for us in terms of how things happen in Los Angeles, but at the same time I don&#39;t know how it really applies to our sound, especially now.</p>

<p><b>What do you feel like your bands relationship to punk is?</b></p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely just an approach rather than a sound. It&#39;s a style of going about it. It&#39;s that attitude of not giving a fuck, or really just doing it for yourself, which I think we&#39;ve always really identified with. As far as being a straight-up genre, I don&#39;t think it applies to us in that sense, but I feel like even now we&#39;re still a very much DIY band. We don&#39;t have much outside help anyway. I think it&#39;s the way it is because it&#39;s the way it has to be; if we want to do this we have to do it ourselves. It&#39;s not necessarily a weird moral thing. That doesn&#39;t really come into it. It&#39;s just like if we want to do this now then let&#39;s just fucking do it. As far as outside help, people have asked to manage us, and we&#39;ve even tried it out, but it doesn&#39;t feel right. It always ends up feeling really sleazy or strange. I guess that sort of is a moral thing. It just kinda doesn&#39;t work. At this point we&#39;ve been doing it ourselves for so long that when somebody else comes in with really bizarre commercial ideas and demands a cut of the money it just seems strange.</p>
