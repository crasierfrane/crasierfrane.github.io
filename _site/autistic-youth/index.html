    <h1>Autistic Youth</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p><b>How did you feel <i>Idle Minds</i> turned out?</b></p>

<p>Nick: I feel really proud of it. I feel that we all did the best that we could so I&#39;m really glad to have it out. We practiced every day for 4 weeks up until the recording. It was amazing. Seve our drummer takes time to map out all of his drum parts perfectly. He obsesses over that and takes a lot of pride in it. I think he&#39;s done a great job on <i>Idle Minds</i>. He did most of that stuff in one or two takes too.</p>

<p><b>What&#39;s the deal with your name?</b></p>

<p>Alex: We went to high school with this kid named Eric Griffiths. He was autistic and the punkest kid in our school. He wore a leather jacket every day no matter how hot it was. He stuck out seriously. He was 6&#39; tall and very punk. He wanted to start a band forever and kept asking us. We had a couple of practices with him, but they didn&#39;t really pan out. I came up with the name as a combination of an homage to him and an homage to 80&#39;s youth bands.</p>

<p>Adam: He was super hyped on it. When we kept playing we were like, Dude we think we&#39;re gonna keep using this name. How do you feel about that? He was like, Yeah, that&#39;s great.</p>

<p>Nick: He still comes to our shows. I feel like people in Portland don&#39;t really dance at shows too often, but he really just throws it down.</p>

<p><b>How do you feel about the idea of having to explain yourself?</b></p>

<p>Adam: It makes me really uncomfortable. I don&#39;t feel like we answer to anyone. Our name&#39;s not really offensive so it&#39;s not even cool to say that we don&#39;t answer to anybody, it&#39;s just kinda obvious. If somebody&#39;s uncomfortable with our name or something that&#39;s been said, and they wanna have a calm open discourse about it then I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an issue. Open discourse is good; communicating with each other and making sure everybody feels comfortable. Somebody wrote an email to a weekly that we did an interview in in Portland. They were angry because their brother was autistic. They sent it to the Autism Society and Autism Speaks. They tried to blow it up as this big issue. Writing back to that guy specifically was kinda like, You should probably do your homework.</p>

<p>Nick: I gues it comes with the territory when you choose a band name like that though.</p>

<p><b>How did Autistic Youth sound back in the day?</b></p>

<p>Adam: It was a lot more simplified. It was supposed to sound shitty. Pretty raw punk. We were just gonna have two guitars and no drums or bass at first. Then we decided to do something a little more structured. More than just getting drunk in our garage.</p>

<p>Alex: I&#39;d been playing guitar for like a month at the time that we started it. I just wanted to do something with it to learn. It was definitely a lot more simple street punk stuff. We had another bassist before and it was just like a fun thing to do in the garage, but then once Nick joined we really started to get involved as musicians and think of each other like that.</p>

<p><b>Who were some of the earlier influences on your playing?</b></p>

<p>Alex: One of our early shows with Gorilla Angreb was a real changing point.</p>

<p>Adam: I feel like in terms of energy, motivation, and just getting hyped on the band I&#39;ve been really influenced by bands that I&#39;ve seen come to Portland on tour. When we first started playing there were a tonne of bands that came from Japan, Sweden, and all over Europe that really influenced me to get more stoked about playing music in general. I&#39;ve been pretty hardcore into the Damned the last couple of years too. I think that guitar playing really gets me going. It&#39;s a pretty badass genius band. Lyrically I&#39;m really inspired by everything Ian MacKaye has done. He was so pissed when he was younger.</p>

<p>Nick: A lot of my bass playing is influenced by Black Sabbath.</p>
