        <p><b>How&#39;s tour going?</b></p>

<p>It&#39;s good. We&#39;ve been with <a href=http://www.cerebralballzy.com/>Cerebral Ballzy</a> for like a week and a half and we were with <a href=>Cancer Bats</a> for like two weeks before that. It feels like it&#39;s progressively gotten crazier as the shows go on. Each show just keeps getting better than the last. Once we linked up with Cerebral Ballzy everything just went downhill. We get a case of beer a night and I don&#39;t think we can even keep it for longer than ten minutes. Cancer Bats dudes it was like they kinda get a little bit wild sometimes, but the day we linked up with Cerebral Ballzy it was like, We&#39;re all fucked. Too many nights being drunk and everyone going separate ways and then just making sure we&#39;re at the van in time to leave to make it to the show. I feel like it&#39;s always just me and Honour from Cerebral Ballzy going out every night and staying up until like 8 in the morning then catching whatever train like from Paris or Amsterdam or wherever the fuck we&#39;re at just to make it to the show.</p>

<p><b>Who are you into from California right now?</b></p>

<p>I love the Bronx. That&#39;s like our big brother band. They&#39;ve done everything from playing every big festival to playing every basement, and putting out a record on a major label to putting out the records themselves. If you have any questions as far as music  goes, or if you&#39;re worried you&#39;re gonna get fucked over by somebody, the Bronx are the first people you call. They can give you an insider view on what the fuck it&#39;s about.</p>

<p><b>What&#39;s the best thing you&#39;ve done through Trash Talk?</b></p>

<p>We got to play a festival like a month ago in Japan in the Saitama Super Arena in Tokyo. It&#39;s a 40,000 person arena where they have all the official kung fu and martial arts tournaments and shit. We played this big metal festival with like Ozzy Osbourne and Motorhead. We played to like 20,000 people. There were two 5,000 person circle pits at the same exact time. Stadium seating with everyone just like pumping their fists and shit. It was like honestly the only time in Trash Talk I&#39;ve looked out and been like, This is fucked up.  As far as little kid dreams coming true shit though, fucking Keith Morris sang on our record. That&#39;s Black Flag. That&#39;s the shit I grew up on.  I was in the studio and Keith Morris walked in. It was just like, Holy fuck. Hearing old stories about like Black Flag and Circle Jerks from the mouth that it actually happened to. It was crazy.</p>

<p><b>It feels like with Eyes &amp; Nines stuff really took off for you guys, kinda like with Fucked Up a few years ago. Were you aware of that?</b></p>

<p>With us and Fucked Up, we both started in basements, DIY venues, small places. It was an underground type thing. It feels like there aren&#39;t really many bands that break past basements and are aggressive. The second somebody caught wind of us it was just like, Holy shit, what the fuck is this? I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. So I feel like it was just kinda like a right place, right time kinda thing. Same with Fucked Up. I&#39;ve talked to those dudes about the same exact thing. At a certain point people just started taking notice. The live show, the aggressiveness of it, I feel like that kinda got people&#39;s attention. It&#39;s been cool. It&#39;s been a weird, humbling experience cuz the hardcore kids, the punk kids we started out playing to, are still here, but there&#39;s also all these new kids. I think it&#39;s cool that bands like us and Fucked Up and even Cerebral Ballzy can be like a gateway drugs to all these other bands. Like somebody loves all these bands that are in the mainstream but they caught on to Trash Talk and now because of us they know who the Dead Kennedys are and who Black Flag is and who Circle Jerks is. I think it&#39;s a good thing that bands who are more aggressive are getting more exposure. It opens up a lot of doors to a whole lot of kids.</p>

<p><b>Do you feel like it&#39;s important to you to draw influence from those early punk bands, but not replicate them?</b></p>

<p>Yeah. I think replication is kinda cheating. Once people find out a formula goes good they&#39;re like we&#39;re just going to do the same formula cuz it works. I think like every band should have their own tip. All of us as a band listen to completely different shit. I listen to punk and hardcore, our guitar player listens to funk, soul and hip hop and makes beats on his MPC all day, our bass player listens to the Doors, David Bowie, and the Rolling Stones, and our drummer likes garage rock and weird shit like that. We all just try to bring our own styles and shit together.  Our guitar player writes songs, but to him it&#39;s all about hip hop and how his head can snap back to it and he can groove to it. If he smokes a blunt and it sounds good to him then it&#39;s good.</p>

<p><b>Is there one thing that unifies it?</b></p>

<p>I think we all just wanna play fast, aggressive music. Push ourselves to the limits at all times. You wait like 23 and a half hours a day for 30 minutes. There&#39;s no reason to fucking go soft. We&#39;ve all talked about this, whether it&#39;s like a psychedelic band or a rapper or a punk band or anything, if they aren&#39;t into it then it&#39;s hard for you as a person who likes their music to be into it. I&#39;ve seen so many bands that I loved on record but I show up to the show and it&#39;s just like boring. That&#39;s why I can&#39;t go to arena shows and big ass shows. I&#39;m so fucking bored. I feel like I&#39;m spoiled as a punk kid cuz I&#39;m just so used to getting smashed around. I think as far as that goes we all just wanna go as hard as we can. Push the limits of ourselves and our music. Play faster, longer, harder than everyone else.</p>

<p><b>Does Trash Talk earn you a living?</b></p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have the need to make a living. We tour like 9 months out of the year so I don&#39;t really have a rent to pay. If I even owned a house or an apartment it wouldn&#39;t be logical. I&#39;d be there for two weeks then leave for three months. Why am I gonna pay rent for all that time? I just live on my friends couches and shit like that. We definitely don&#39;t make enough money to pay rent yet, but I know that when I&#39;m on tour I&#39;ll be able to eat at least one meal a day, and drink whatever I want, and smoke all the weed I want. The thing is, I could be at home with a job, have an apartment, a girlfriend, whatever, all this bullshit, but right now I&#39;m in Glasgow. I&#39;ll be in Manchester tomorrow. I was in Paris a few nights ago, and Japan three weeks ago. I would definitely trade an apartment and a real life for sleeping on floors every day. I could be sitting in a cubicle, but I&#39;d rather explore the world while I&#39;m young. When you&#39;re 40 years old it&#39;s time to figure it all out, but I have all the time in the world right now so fuck it.</p>
