        <p><b>What&#39;s the story of Night Birds?</b></p>

<p>The Ergs! played a show with Brian&#39;s old band, For Science. Brian was wearing an Adolescents shirt (the blue one) and I remember thinking I&#39;d like to start a band with someone else who likes The Adolescents. We got together with a couple of the guys from local NJ legends The Degenerics and started working on some stuff that became the early Night Birds songs.</p>

<p>The band sort of fizzled out before we could play or record anything, but once The Ergs! broke up I thought we should reform with Mike on guitar. He was the obvious choice. His style is perfect and his knowledge of surf music is what I would (but I&#39;m sure he would not) call encyclopedic.</p>

<p><b>Do you enjoy working with genres like surf/country where there&#39;s pretty defined stylistic rules?</b></p>

<p>Yeah, but only because I&#39;m not a good enough songwriter to dump all the rules and make my own. I start with the rules and deviate from there. I don&#39;t think there are too many associated with surf music though. Pretty much the only one is that you have to either have the awash-in-reverb surf guitar sound or be based around the Beach Boys-type melody/harmony thing. It&#39;s pretty obvious which route we took.</p>

<p><b>When did you start playing bass?</b></p>

<p>I think I was around 15.</p>

<p><b>Who were some earlier influences on your playing?</b></p>

<p>I&#39;ve always ripped off Karl Alvarez of Descendents/All pretty hard. When I first started playing bass, his lines were the ones I would try to learn.</p>

<p><b>What do you think draws you to that instrument?</b></p>

<p>I hate to have the stereotypical garage band reason for playing bass, but the truth is I made friends with the punk kids in high school and they all already played instruments decently. I wanted to play music with them so I picked bass because it had the fewest strings and seemed to require the least amount of time to get competent at.</p>

<p><b>How have the Ergs reunion shows been?</b></p>

<p>They were fun. We raised a lot of money and by all accounts we didn&#39;t stink the joint out or anything. I didn&#39;t know if I was going to enjoy them before I got up there, but I had a blast. It feels way different. It&#39;s not an active band and each of us has moved on in a lot of ways. At the earlier shows we did, the crowd was mostly younger kids who had never seen us before that day.</p>

<p><b>How come you guys called it a day?</b></p>

<p>Jeff didn&#39;t want to do it anymore. We always had a rule that if anyone left the band it was over.</p>

<p><b>Did it feel weird to end a high school band after such a long time?</b></p>

<p>Yeah, it was a big life change. It&#39;s like going out with the same girl since the beginning of high school, calling it off after 10 years, and then entering the dating scene for the first time. In a lot of ways, you don&#39;t get out of that high school, teenage mentality until you move on and can look back on it with some perspective.</p>
