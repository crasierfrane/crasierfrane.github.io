        <p><b>How&#39;s working with a band changed your music?</b></p>

<p>It&#39;s made it a lot more fun. Playing by yourself is really stressful. Too much pressure for me. I don&#39;t wanna do it any more. I used to feel if I recorded something and put it out I&#39;d have to play it live the same way. Now I feel comfortable just making recordings and getting really weird.</p>

<p><b>Have you always felt like you wanted to do this project as a band?</b></p>

<p>It started off just me wanting to record stuff. The first thing I ever recorded was a full band style cassette tape. Then some people wanted me to play so I just started playing by myself because everybody else was busy. That developed into all those songs turning into one man band songs. Then I recorded this one man band style record. After that I realised I wanted to do something else.</p>

<p><b>Do you feel like you need projects like <i>Sic Alps</i>, where you aren&#39;t in control creatively, to take a bit of time out?</b></p>

<p>Oh yeah. Just playing is so fun. I don&#39;t always like being <i>the dude</i> in the band. I love playing drums. I love feeling like you&#39;re backing somebody up.</p>

<p><b>I read you&#39;re thinking of slowing down your output.</b></p>

<p>At first when I started releasing stuff I wanted to put out as much as I could just to get stuff out there. By no means of course putting out anything bad or that I didn&#39;t think was good, but I just kept going, kept trucking. Now I feel like slowly I&#39;ve honed in more on what I&#39;d actually like to put out.</p>

<p>I really wanna make the best record I can. That means saving everything that I think is good for this next record instead of putting it out on a single. I want all the songs be at least like a 9 out of 10. I wanna throw the song that&#39;s a 7&#189; out.</p>

<p><b>How&#39;s that working out?</b></p>

<p>It&#39;s been a long process, but it&#39;s been good. I&#39;ve been working on this record from before <i>Melted</i> even came out. I&#39;m about 75% done. I think I&#39;m going to call it <i>Goodbye Bread</i>.</p>

<p><b>Are there any new areas you&#39;re exploring?</b></p>

<p>It&#39;s another step in the direction <i>Melted</i> went except it&#39;s not as fried. It&#39;s weirder. It&#39;s more mellow. It&#39;s more psychedelic. It&#39;s pretty dark and sarcastic. I&#39;d like people to read the lyrics. I&#39;ve never felt comfortable with my lyrics before. This time I actually do. For the first time I have a pinpointed idea of what I want to say about something. Every other time I&#39;ve written stuff it&#39;s been more all over the place.</p>
