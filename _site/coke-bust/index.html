        <p><b>How&#39;s tour going?</b></p>

<p>Nick: Tour has been awesome. It started out a little bit rough because a bunch of us missed our first flight and we lost 3 out of 5 of our bags. We got pulled over by the cops going into Amsterdam. We missed <a href=http://www.myspace.com/seeinred>Seein Red</a> and <a href=http://www.myspace.com/extortionextortion>Extortion</a> which we were bummed about. Then the next day we got a flat tire because we drove over a bolt in some lousy area. But this tour has been fucking tight. It&#39;s been fun, we&#39;re all having a great time.</p>

<p><b>How do you feel you&#39;ve been received?</b></p>

<p>Jeremy: Really positive. You can tell in America who&#39;s been in a band that&#39;s been over to Europe by the way they treat you. They bring you back to their house and they&#39;ve got food waiting. You can tell the ones who&#39;ve heard about what happens because then they bring you over to their house and they&#39;ve got like microwave egg waffles for you like, Yeah, here&#39;s breakfast.</p>

<p>Nick: Those are the ones who cook for you at all. Most of the time you just show up, you play, you get $60 and then drive to the next town.</p>

<p>Jeremy: Some places you get $11 in change and they&#39;re like, Ah well, it was donations. You gotta drive 7 hours? Sorry, have fun. Come back though.</p>

<p>Nick: That&#39;s what we&#39;re used to. That&#39;s just the normal thing for us. Then we come to Europe and we get all this special treatment. It&#39;s like dessert every meal.</p>

<p><b>Do you have any horror stories from shows in the US?</b></p>

<p>Chris: In like St. Louis or something the promoter didn&#39;t ask the house if he could do the show, he just thought we could all sneak in</p>

<p>Jeremy: He let us know when we were five minutes away from the show with a text message, Oh, by the way, the show that&#39;s supposed to happen in half an hour isn&#39;t happening.</p>

<p>Nick: Tucson, Arizona. Terrible. We played a show there with some black metal bands a couple of weeks before we came over here. It was terrible. One of the bands had a fog machine and a bunch of candles though. That was pretty tight.</p>

<p>Chris: Shane Embury from Napalm Death said we were awesome and that was kinda cool.</p>

<p>Jeremy: He also said he was gonna come to our show.</p>

<p>Chirs: Yeah, he didn&#39;t show up to our Birmingham gig.</p>

<p>Nick: What a fucking poser, man. I&#39;ve been around longer than he has. He just started coming out to shows yesterday. What the fuck? I was born in 1986, man. Nah I&#39;m just kidding, Napalm Death is tight.</p>

<p><b>Do you feel like your style has changed over different recordings you&#39;ve done?</b></p>

<p>Nick: It&#39;s gotten faster. We started out as just kinda like a fast hardcore band. Then with Chris, of <a href=http://www.myspace.com/magrudergrind>Magrudergrind</a> fame, he&#39;s really sped things up: taken that Magrudergrind sound, that distinct Magrudergrind influence, and really brought it to the table for Coke Bust. It&#39;s really worked out very well for us so far.</p>

<p>Chris: Nick&#39;s Griptape and <a href=http://www.myspace.com/bailout>Bailout</a> fame has really stepped up the energy and the depth of the lyrics in the band. We&#39;re just trying to update our formulas from before and kinda take it to the next level.</p>

<p><b>Is there anything that&#39;s got easier or harder to do?</b></p>

<p>Nick: It&#39;s gotten a little bit harder to tour just because we&#39;ve all gotten older and as you get older you get a lot more responsibilities. With that said, Chris is unemployed, Jubert&#39;s unemployed, I work for a fucking temp agency, I could quit tomorrow it doesn&#39;t even matter. Fuck yeah.</p>

<p>Jeremy: It&#39;s also gotten harder because we&#39;ve all started or joined multiple other bands. I think between the four of us there&#39;s about ten bands. Probably more.</p>

<p>Nick: But, things have gotten easier. Touring has gotten easier. More people are willing to book shows for us so we don&#39;t have to play racist shows in Ohio. That&#39;s always good.</p>

<p>Chris: People are starting to catch on to Nick&#39;s roots in Bailout and Griptape.</p>

<p>Nick: Two absolutely crucial bands for the hardcore genre. We&#39;re criminally underrated. If you don&#39;t know Griptape, fuck you. Go home. You&#39;re a poser.</p>

<p>Chris: I guess I can&#39;t talk. I played in Griptape too.</p>

<p><b>Do you think ultimately the responsibilities might win?</b></p>

<p>Jeremy: I dunno, I&#39;m 33 and I&#39;m still living like I&#39;m 18.  Fuck yeah.</p>

<p>Jubert: I&#39;ll always be in Coke Bust, no matter who else quits.</p>
