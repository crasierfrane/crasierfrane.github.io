    <h1>Mean Jeans</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p><b>What does Mean Jeans mean?</b></p>

<p>Billy Jeans: Nothing. It was spray-painted on my parents&#39; house and I thought it sounded stupid.</p>

<p><b>How have your European tours been?</b></p>

<p>Billy Jeans: Both trips were wild beer-soaked rides. I was seriously surprised places like Karlsruhe, Munich, Stockholm, and Paris had so many goons who’d wanna get that drunk and see the Jeans stink it up. Pretty much everyone we met in Europe was 3 to 4 times cooler than my friends here. :(</p>

<p>Jeans Wilder: It was the ultimate. It was the insane. Never a dull moment. Every show was packed 2 the gillz with cretins. Except maybe our show in the Basque country in Spain. That was a different story.</p>

<p>Billy Jeans: I was fa-lipping. Like, you know how you would describe Priest as ripping insanity? I’d imagine. Well, we were on this boat in fuckin Stockholm, ripping &amp; raging and the sun never set the whole time dude. It was crazed bro. Now stack that up against Gilly at the Paladium, in ‘86. Sha!</p>

<p><b>Where would you say your biggest fanbase is?</b></p>

<p>Jeans Wilder: According to our buddy Petey in Pure Country Gold, our biggest fanbase is in Las Cruces, New Mexico. We’ve never been there, but he says that everyone there is the world’s largest Mean Jeans fan. They found out that he played Steve in the <i>Steve Don’t Party No More</i> video and all hell broke loose.</p>

<p><b>How did Mean Jeans get started, and what&#39;s the story since then?</b></p>

<p>Billy Jeans: Jeans Wilder and I were putting in a lot of time in his parents&#39; basement getting really drunk, playing with his dad’s guns and talking about how much stuff sucks.  We were listening to The Queers - <i>Love Songs For The Retarded</i> and laughing at how dumb it is to try to sound like the Ramones. So we figured we’d try to rip off the bands who rip off the Ramones. It makes sense. We wrote <i>Party Animal</i> and <i>2 Much Cocaine</i> that day and now we live somewhere else and are still playing those stupid songs.</p>

<p><b>You&#39;ve made a couple of videos that look like you just had parties and filmed them, were they fun to make?</b></p>

<p>Billy Jeans: Yes. We got Pabst to sponsor the video for <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaVXvtb6ddo>Steve Don’t Party No More</a>. They gave us a ton of beer and we drank it in our backyard and filmed it.  I figured the fans would finally get an inside look at what our lives are really like when the smoke and cameras disappear. Well, there was one camera.</p>

<p>Jeans Wilder: Yeah, I was so busy gettin’ amped on Mountain Dew and pickles that I didn’t even get to drink one of the million beers that Pabst hooked us up with. People partied hard and the beer went fast.</p>

<p><b>What&#39;s Stoned 2 the Bone about?</b></p>

<p>Billy Jeans: The song is about staying wasted enough to be numb to the reality that pretty much everything is bogus. To the bone.  There <i>is</i> a lyric sheet inside that 7 with spiders and barf all over it, but I understand there were only 300 copies made.</p>

<p><b>Do you get lots of hate for being Ramonescore?</b></p>

<p>Billy Jeans: I’ve never heard that word other than people asking us if we are Ramonescore, or saying that we suck because we are Ramonescore.  I like the Ramones alot. They are gnarly. Who gives a shit?</p>

<p><b>What have you got planned in terms of recordings?</b></p>

<p>Jeans Wilder: We are doing a 4-way covers split on Trouble in Mind sometime soon, and then we are also doing ANOTHER 4-way split of Portland bands for some sort of crazy Mutant Punk Monster Party Jam where we all dress up and record in one day and film it and get drunk and rent a million dollar state-of-the-art studio. Something like that.</p>

<p>Billy Jeans: It’s gonna be crazed bro.</p>
