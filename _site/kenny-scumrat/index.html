        <p><b>So why are you guys ending the band?</b></p>

<p>Um well to the best of my knowledge pretty much just like kinda because Brandon is not really into touring so much any more. Alex and I kinda were both on the same page as far as like if we&#39;re not gonna tour then there&#39;s really no point in doing the band. So, it&#39;s better to just kill it off now than y&#39;know drag it along for a long time without any out of town shows.</p>

<p><b>Is there anything you&#39;re moving onto next?</b></p>

<p>Yeah, actually. I&#39;m playing bass in a hardcore band right now called Unholy Thoughts with one of the guys from my other band <a href=http://www.myspace.com/thesouthsidestranglers>the Southside Stranglers</a>. It&#39;s kinda like heavy hardcore shit. I&#39;m playing bass. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been working on for four years but could never get a steady line-up to get going.</p>

<p><b>Where&#39;s the best place you got to go on tour?</b></p>

<p>I dunno I&#39;d say probably my favourite places might&#39;ve been like Copenhagen or eh maybe Belgium. I dunno. A lot of those shows, the really good ones especially, are kinda lost in the void now from drinking and partying. I&#39;d say my favourite place that I went was probably Copenhagen.</p>

<p><b>Why&#39;s that?</b></p>

<p>Really mostly for me I think it&#39;s just because of the punks there. It&#39;s kinda mind-blowing how fucking sick those kids are. They&#39;re totally fucking nuts man. They&#39;re out of their god damn minds and I totally love it.  Also that&#39;s the first time I saw Night Fever and that&#39;s probably my favourite band that I heard all of last year.</p>

<p><b>With Government Warning was there a chartable sense of progress?</b></p>

<p>Um kinda. I mean not necessarily. I feel like the way that band moved and progressed was kinda all just really dependant on the way punk was moving and progressing over the last like decade. It kinda moved along with us. Like things that I had been into since I was younger, like that old hardcore sound, just became more of a regular thing. In a lot of towns and a lot of cities. All over the world it sorta meshed. I feel like what we were doing just kinda all depended on what town we were in and how much they enjoyed that.</p>

<p><b>Do you feel like in different places you get treated differently?</b></p>

<p>Yeah I suppose. I got the feeling, the impression, that a lot of the folks I met around Germany weren&#39;t really particularly into the way we did things. We&#39;re kinda retarded and drunk. We&#39;re fucking stupid. When it all boils down to it that&#39;s just the way I live every day. Drunk and fucking dumb. There&#39;s places like southern California where that goes over great then there&#39;s certain towns in Germany where it&#39;s like, What do you mean you get in fist fights with other punks? It&#39;s like, We get in fist fights with everybody, we&#39;re just dumb and drunk and fucking everything up all the time. In some places that&#39;s cool and in other places I guess it&#39;s not</p>

<p><b>Do you feel like there are connections between your art and your lyrics?</b></p>

<p>Sometimes. I dunno I guess that was kinda the idea, especially with the last LP. I think he did a pretty good job of capturing the entire theme of the record, or at least from where I was sitting when I wrote that song. How I was feeling. I was kinda in a weird fucking place. It was summed up pretty well by the cover art. I always tended to do silly little doodles on the lyrics sheets because that was my way of illustrating the point.</p>

<p><b>Has the way you made music changed over the years?</b></p>

<p>I would say the only one that was really different was the last stuff we did. The first record was Brandon&#39;s label. The second record was with Jannick from <a href=http://www.feralward.com/>Feral Ward</a>. He pretty much just left all that in our hands. That was also with the steadiest line-up, the No Moderation/Arrested line-up. That was what we did most of the touring in most of the years with. I&#39;d say the only one that was really different was the last LP because by that point Eric had already moved to Pittsburgh, and then Raleigh, and wherever the fuck else he moved to. He&#39;s lived everywhere. Actually it was like Alex writing half the songs on that one. Whereas he hadn&#39;t written any of the ones before. I actually even wrote one of the ones on the last record. The title track. That&#39;s the only song I ever wrote for the band. Before that it was pretty much only Brandon and Eric hashing things out together.</p>

<p><b>Is there any one thing that you&#39;d say Government Warning is about?</b></p>

<p>I dunno. We took the name of the band off of a beer can when we couldn&#39;t come up with a name . That was pretty much all it was about for me. Serious chronic alcoholic behaviour. In general, it was always more about releasing aggression I suppose. If there was one little common theme to the whole career as a band it was just violence for fun.</p>

<p><b>Is there anything that you&#39;d wanna have the band remembered for?</b></p>

<p>Um, not in particular. It&#39;s a hardcore band. To me it was just always like do it for your own reason. Just for fun. If that means anything to someone else then that&#39;s great, but I honestly don&#39;t give a fuck if anyone remembers us in ten years. There&#39;s so many hardcore bands that were so great that were lost in the void. You can&#39;t expect this one to do better than any of the rest.</p>

<p><b>There&#39;s a sense of being detached from your hometown in your songs. What&#39;s the source of that?</b></p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot to it. When we started Government Warning I had been straight-edge for years. When I had a big legal debacle that happened around the time I was 18 or so everything in my life changed. My entire lifestyle just turned on its ear because I was just ready for change and I was ready to approach things differently. All the friends that I had made in the hardcore scene gave me a big fuck you when I stopped being straight edge because I wasn&#39;t a part of that world any more. Honestly I hadn&#39;t really felt a part of that world for a long time so to me it was just doing what I wanted to do and honestly losing all that, all the attachments there, and just honestly hating everything about the fucking people in this town, the way the kids get into hardcore and they&#39;re there for a year or two then next time you see them they&#39;ve got a beard and some stupid glasses and cut off short shorts. Fucking posers man. I dunno. I always got a little frustrated with how this is like a really artsy fartsy town. It&#39;s like a little town that always thought of itself as a big fashionable town. I just can&#39;t stand the smugness of it. It&#39;s getting better though and I&#39;ve gotten more comfortable with it. I&#39;m still ready to leave though. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever happen at the rate I&#39;m going, but it&#39;d be nice.</p>

<p><b>So was tour an escape?</b></p>

<p>Yeah. I mean honestly the only time I&#39;m really happy and comfortable in my life is when I&#39;m on the road. All the tours we did are some of the greatest single experiences in my life. I&#39;d never been off the East Coast before we started the band. The furthest I&#39;d been from home was like one or two states away. It was one of those things where you have to go to the West Coast, go to Texas, go to Europe. It was fucking great man. It was always an escape. Like a release.</p>

<p><b>I kinda picked up on a strong theme of hating like mediocre stereotypes, like jocks and stuff like that. Is mediocrity something you really despise?</b></p>

<p>Yeah man. that&#39;s all the same people that gave me shit my entire life for being the way I am. When I was a kid my pants were too fucking tight but now it&#39;s still one of these things where these fucking douchebags have to yell some shit at you from a balcony like about how like, Oh your pants are tighter than my sister. I fucking hate people like that. The only thing they can hope for in life is getting a shitty fucking job that they work at until they die. Having a shitty fucking life that they hate. Having a wife they hate. Having kids they fucking hate. Resenting everyone for every minute of their life that they wasted. They hate me because I don&#39;t live that way. I think it&#39;s just one of those things where we&#39;re gonna be pitted against each other for the rest of our fucking lives. That&#39;s punk though. I&#39;m so fucking used to it. I&#39;ve had way too much of that shit here.</p>
