<b>You moved from North Carolina to Baltimore a while ago. Has operating in a different city had a big impact on how you work?</b>

Sam: Well it's had a big impact on how we think so it's had a big impact on how we work. That move was to get more serious about what we're doing and kinda take away the comfort of where we were. We were completely changing our brains and the way we were thinking. Since we've been in Baltimore we've pretty much been on the road. We could have done that living wherever, but Baltimore's been really great for the kind of community that lives there. You're close to everything. You're close to where you want to be and you can still exist without killing yourself.  You can still be a working musician and working artist without having to work another job or two to pay for that.

<b>Is it important for you as a band to be able to live that way?</b>

Sam: I think it can go both ways because I think there's something about having a routine of work. If the three of us worked regular jobs it'd be harder for us to get together, but I think when we got together we might have more inspiration because it sucks working. Instead sometimes it's kinda rough because we get off 3/4 months of almost straight touring and the last thing we wanna do is write a song or, I say this jokingly, even look at each other. There's at least like a week where we might just talk on the phone or see each other at a bar. We spend so much time together, and we're the best of friends, but it's kind of a thing like, I need to be alone for a while.

<b>You're getting a lot more press these days. Has there been anything in particular that's really surprised you?</b>

Sam: Yeah, we got some good stuff from the BBC and from NPR, which is like national radio in the states. Those kinds of things are really cool. Apparently somebody from the NME was at the show last night so we're waiting to see if they're gonna rip us. Or write anything at all. We did a show out in LA that was like a radio show for the Los Angeles NPR station. For us, we didn't really know, but Thrill Jockey were like, You <i>have</i> to do this. You have to fly out there and do this one show at 9am in the morning. We flew out to do this one thing and they set up some other press junkets. We were gonna be out there for a couple of days so we were like, Screw it, let's book some shows. So we got up with our friend Kyle and set up that he was gonna put us up for a few days and drive us around. So we ended up doing like 4 or 5 shows while in LA. Stayed at his house. Did a crazy, crazy press day. An insane press day. That was a fun tour. Hanging out in LA. It felt like we lived there. It was kinda wild though. That show was really big for us. We didn't realise that that's such an influential thing. We'd never heard of it. It's funny cuz I didn't tell my girlfriend what the show was and she was visiting her parents and then called me and was like, You didn't tell me you were on Morning Becomes Eclectic. And I was like, I told you we were on a radio show. I don't know anything about it. She was like, Me and my mom have listened to that show since I was like a kid. I stream it online. I'd never heard of it before. That really opened LA up to us.

<b>Would you say videos are an important medium to you as a band?</b>

William: I think it's definitely important to make videos. When we first did one we were really just excited and enthusiastic, but over time we've had a lot of people with different treatments and stuff so it's more daunting than anything else at this point. I think we've all decided we don't necessarily want to be in the videos. A lot of the times they want you to act and I don't wanna do that. Gerrit doesn't wanna do that. I don't think Samuel necessarily wants to do that. The Tin Man video is I think a step in the next direction of what our videos are gonna be like . More hands off, and hopefully more of an artful approach.  I think with our early videos a big problem I had was that directors latched onto this whole bright neon image of the other artists associated with Wham City. I think they assumed that everyone involved with that was doing this heavy neon over the top thing. I think we realised that we weren't that and we were allowed to do other visual stuff.

Sam: Something beautiful instead of just more eccentric. I think those earlier videos were a lot more eccentric, like colourful and bright, in a different way than the Tin Man video is colourful and bright. Like it's bright with real life and the beauty of real things. Those early videos are important too to our growth and understanding. They do come back to haunt you though.

<b>How did making the Tin Man video work in terms of the creative process? Were you involved?</b>

William: Sorta. Like a year before our album came out we started playing some of the songs and our friend Jay from New York was like, I wanna do the video for Tin Man when it comes out. We're like, Alright, dude. You got it. So a year later the album's coming out we're like, Dude you wanna do this video? He's still like totally down. He had this idea to come to Baltimore and film around with us just hanging out. We thought it'd be more meaningful for us to go to North Carolina where we spent a lot more time. We have more roots there. So the idea was basically to just go to places that had significant meaning to us from our childhood and upbringing. Old haunts. Jay was right there with us for that idea. So we just went down for the weekend and went to Morehead City, then Greenvile, Wendell, Chapel Hil, over into a show we played that weekend, then back to Baltimore at the end. It was just kinda like a montage of all that footage. For our next album I wanna have a video that Jay does in the same style that's like kind of a part two, but like where we're at at that point. Like documentary style. I think it'd be really cool to have like the same idea but with a different song and new images.

<b>Do you think the character of the band has become more serious as you've progressed?</b>

Sam: I think so, and I think a lot of that is just like us growing up a bit and realising where we've been and where we wanna be. Not making music that's just like fun. I think we're just realising that we wanna push ourselves to create something that's really meaningful. That kinda does take away that fun, and there is that worry too about alienating an older audience of ours who appreciate the good fun times when they could dance. But y'know, we have to make something for ourselves too. And it is for the audience as well. It's even more so because we're delving a lot deeper into the truth of what we're doing and into ourselves as musicians.

<b>This one's for Sam. Where do you think the theatre and drama in your performance style comes from?</b>

Sam: Well a lot of it comes from our first band where I did play a character and it was more like theatre. Then Future Islands started and it was a very different thing. Trying to get used to having to be myself on stage and being completely unguarded. A lot of it's just in the strength of performing and getting used to it. But also, wanting to give people a show and really enacting the words. I've always said like, especially with live shows, you can't always hear what people are saying so you kinda have to show them. So I really try to show people what I'm talking about so that they feel it even if they don't understand. They still feel it because I'm feeling it. I've also said that before when people ask why I've got so much energy on stage. I'm like, Well if I'm not feeling it then who the fuck else is going to feel it? If I'm not into this music then how am I gonna get anybody else into it? So it's really just kinda a labour of really digging deep and pushing it out, but also knowing a bit and testing the grounds of where you can go on stage. I really try to go between complete breakdown, like fragile, dying human, and the strength of just like a strong character who can't be heard. You go between those extremes and you find people in the middle.

William: Dying human?

Sam: Yeah, maybe that's a little rough.

<b>Is there anything you see as an ultimate goal for the band?</b>

Sam: Ummm we basically wanna be U2. There's a whole bunch of business bullshit we're dealing with now. It's really difficult thinking about this. We didn't get into music to think about these things but now we've realised it's what we wanna do and what we're best at. We're a fucking great band. We're learning a lot of things.

William: We've been doing this for like 7 years now. Writing songs and touring. I guess when we get to the point where we're not poor. If we can get through a whole year of not being broke, having some months off, and not being insane.

Sam: Just very simple things like getting a decent guarantee so we can eat and pay our bills when we're not on the road. The biggest thing is we gotta write this next great thing and get it out to the world. Then write another great album and get it out to the world then write another great album. So that's like the biggest thing. We're trying to get to the point where we're an established band who has a great fanbase, people that really care about what we do, and we can keep working hard. That's a difficult thing. It's kinda like you can't look too far in the future. You just need to take it in your stride and keep going. Doing music, being a musician, going after something like that, it's a pipe dream.
