<b>What are you working on right now?</b>

We're helping to build an exhibit at a science museum called <a href=http://www.exploratorium.edu/>The Exploratorium</a> in San Francisco. It's going to be part of a program they're doing about the science of sharing. We're talking about using a lot of videos to do with moir√© patterns. You have two high contrast patterns and you put one around the other one and they generate sort of impossible shapes when they intersect; a new image is produced by interference between the first two.

<b>Do you think it's important to Lucky Dragons to operate in artistic environments as opposed to solely performing in music spaces?</b>

For us there really hasn't been so much of a distinction between one or the other. In the states, live music is almost a subsidiary of the liquor industry. We have a policy of only playing all ages shows, which means that the venues that are open for us to play are much more like community centres, or places where people who are at the show take a much more active role in putting the show together. That also goes on to mean that the spaces that we play are not always solely music venues, but also art venues, houses, book stores, community centres, churches, whatever. It opens up a really nice wide range of multi-use kinds of places to play at, and I think that's really important to us. It attracts a much more diverse audience than you'd usually get at music shows.

<b>What's the deal with <a href=http://sumiinkclub.com/>Sumi Ink Club</a>?</b>

It's a club anyone can join, which is pretty dorky but it works out.  In my mind it's kind of like a visual version of the Lucky Dragons show. It's something that we've been doing for the same amount of time, but it's much easier to give these really basic rules about. It's open to the public. People come and collaborate to make a drawing together using the same kind of brushes. The drawing as an image is made public domain so anybody can then take it and remix it, recontextualize it, take details from it and make prints or shirts. People in other parts of the world have taken that and made their own Sumi Ink Clubs.  That's something I wish we could do with Lucky Dragons. It's much easier to do with something as simple as a way of drawing though.

<b>You've made a lot of music. How has the process changed over the years?</b>

It's funny because I feel like this year we've slowed down a lot in our production of music to focus on other kinds of projects that are less album based. We started a website called <a href=http://newotherthing.epmoa.org/>New Other Thing</a> where we're trying to work on a mode of streaming music. I think that's maybe going to be more of the model that we'll take instead of pressing vinyl all the time.

Making our music more ubiquitous and getting it out there more has always been a goal. Now it's become much easier to do that, to almost like aggressively share it. I think the recording has always been this really nice balance to live stuff because it's something that can be inserted into so many different contexts. With a live thing there's something much more controlling about the context that it's in. It's nice to have something that people can really take ownership of and start building their own associations with.

<b>Tell me about the show you're doing in Glasgow. How's it going to work?</b>

It's going to be really interesting, because it's something that the people at <a href=http://www.thearches.co.uk/>The Arches</a> are really collaborating with us on. They proposed this element to it where people submit videos, which I think is really cool because there hasn't been that kind of social element to the video stuff that we've done before.

We're going to bring along our <i>Make a Baby</i> instrument so people can try it out. It's going to be manipulating both audio and video through skin contact. At this point the instruments have kinda taken the roles of songs. We'll have a set where we use one instrument then another. That's kinda become our hit song that people always wanna hear.

<b>How did you first start to get interested in working interactively?</b>

Everything sort of grew up together: there was an interest in interaction; there was an interest in making music; there was an interest in creating a social experience and experimenting with electronics. Sometimes they cross over and combine, sometimes they go different directions. Those interests have always been there, but there hasn't always been a nice technical way of having that feedback, where people can interact and then see what they're doing.

<b>Was there anything in particular that influenced you in that approach?</b>

We're definitely part of a scene. People who are our peers that we work with all the time; friends that are doing things that are inspiring to us and are encouraging us. It's always been more about the social experience of music and the politics of putting on a show, starting a band, producing records. More of a punk background. That's probably been the most tangible influence.
