<b>It seems like you've become less interested in abstractions over the years. How come?</b>

I made monochromes for a year in 2008. As far as colour and surface, I learnt a lot, but I wanted to be quite generous with my pictures, so I found the limitations too great. The discourse one has to enter into, of modernity, and minimalism and reductive painting, wasn't that interesting to me. I wasn't interested in sitting down, reading about it, researching it, or even becoming a part of it. I'm more interested in exploring things that are personal to me, that nobody can invent other than myself.

<b>What are you working on at the moment?</b>

I've doubled the width of the scale I worked with for the majority of this year, so now I'm working on 3 meters wide by 180cm high. I'm also currently trying to introduce a new figure. I made at least 7 paintings this year of the shepherd with his head bowed amongst his flock of sheep. This new subject is also a shepherd, but this time it's based on a photograph of my dad that my mum took about 25 years ago.

He took 3 or 4 sheep to be judged in a competition. The judges were supposed to walk round and look at these sheep, but no one looked at his all day. In the image he looks quite proud, but he never did it again. He never even spoke about it. His expectation wasn't fulfilled. As far as he was concerned he had the best sheep on the field, but nobody looked at them.

<b>What do you feel your collection <i>Great Expectations</i> was about?</b>

<i>Great Expectations</i> was to do with the expectations which an artist takes with them. The expectations you have at your degree show, and at your MA show. The expectations you're surrounded by constantly. I guess it was about disappointment as much as expectation. I suppose it was also about believing in and trying to capture an image. I find a certain freedom within using the same image again.

<b>How did that interest in repetition develop?</b>

It mostly came from thinking about posters. What interested me is the way posters replicate, but also maintain quality. Particularly, the Rocky poster where he's standing at the top of the steps punching the air. That image stuck in my mind. I realised I'd rather have that Â£6 poster on my wall than a piece of artwork from Viner Street worth a few grand that's half-arsed and a bit shit.

<b>What's the significance of colour to your paintings?</b>

Colour is one of the few consistent investigations in my work. I've always had an interest in contrast. I've always had an interest in filling the canvas, and using a variety of colours.

I'm quite into the trippy, psychedelic nature of my paintings. I like to play on that. There's one in particular, <i>Great Expectations - I Told Everyone</i>. People have commented on it looking like a Hendrix cover. I was sort of aware of that when I got into it and started using oranges and yellows and darker tones. It reminds me of an album cover, but I couldn't say what it was. It feels familiar. I like that, because often I think of my work as quite unfamiliar.
