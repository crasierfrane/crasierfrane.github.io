<b>Are there any particular shows or moments that you'd pick out from your tour right now as highlights?</b>

Aviram: When we were in mainland Europe we were really like taken by surprise at some of the hospitality. It was pretty consistent between Prague, Milan, and Barcelona especially. People were like really going out of their way to accommodate us in this really nice way. The way we're touring is not in a van, just planes and trains. So often we need a ride or have to have someone figure out for us how to get to where we wanna go.

Peter:  I always sorta feel like I'm a monk on tour, sorta like asking for donations because I have no possessions or something.

Aviram: Even though you have a massive keyboard strapped to you at all times. But that could be a sorta sacrificial thing. Penance.

Peter: That's like me climbing the steps on my knees to the top of the cathedral. It's my cross. That and all the guilt from all the terrible things I've done.

<b>Have you guys been differently received across different parts of Europe?</b>

Aviram: I think it's been pretty consistent on this tour which is nice.

Ethan:  I think also we're kinda fortunate to have engaged a pretty specific DIY community. I think the thing for me throughout the tour is how every promoter has done a good job of making a show where it's like about the bands or something. I feel like I've definitely been to shows in Europe or played shows in Europe where it's like there's a bar and that's the thing that's happening, and there might or might not be a band but it's definitely about the bar. I feel ilke we've been really fortunate that every single show has been like this one.

Aviram: In Milan especially. The person organising the show wasn't even a promoter. The show we did was the second show he'd ever done. He brought over these friends of ours from New York that were doing a joint tour, <a href=http://www.myspace.com/lederest>LED ER EST</a> and <a href=http://www.myspace.com/xenoandoaklander>Xeno and Oaklander</a>. He's just like a friend of theirs and a friend of ours. But it was so well organised. It was as though he'd done a hundred shows.

Peter: There's a certain number of details you have to attend to. There aren't that many, but if you do all of them then it generally will probably be a good show. He knew what they all were.

Aviram: Having a proper sound guy. Arranging a place to stay. Some transportation to the airport. It's one thing if it's sorta the norm for you if you're doing it on a regular basis, but this person wasn't, so it was kinda impressive that he really understood how to do it.

<b>In the US do you not get that?</b>

Aviram: Unless you're a band that has a greater demand for it then you don't. There's a large gap. It's like there's no middle class of bands. You're either a rich band or a poor band. You can have good shows where people will come and see you, but the amount of things you can ask for is limited. You can't say, We need backline, or, We need transportation. Even a meal or anything. It's all like left up to you.

Ethan: Even on a practical level we have encountered a lot of sound engineers at these shows in Europe who are like, Why do you have your own mic? Because we're used to being self-sufficient.

Peter: You just need to imagine that nothing will be there and everything will go wrong. You just need to kinda take it into your own control. We're not control freaks by nature though.

Aviram: We do what we can to sorta ensure the best experience for us and the audience as well. So it's like, we carry our own DI boxes. I think that's kinda like going pretty far, but in a way that's like really just so small it doesn't take much to do that.

Peter: And there's been shows where that's been a problem.

Aviram: We just try to do what we can so that it will sound good for everybody.

<b>How would you say Silk Flowers has changed as you've moved from working with different labels?</b>

Aviram: I think if you didn't see us and you just heard the records there was like a perception of the kind of band that we are, but it's like somewhat inaccurate. There are ways that it relates for sure and there are definitely certain influences that we include, but at this juncture we're just trying to improve upon what our intention is. So with the new grouping of songs, rather than have like a broader umbrella of influence that we consider we sorta just narrowed it down a little bit more and try to do our take on a certain aspect of what we were already doing. It doesn't have to do with like changing so much, just sorta like expanding upon a smaller aspect of the band. It is sorta a transitional kinda thing. I think we're like moving away from making a little bit more heavy-handed music.

Ethan: I think it's interesting because PPM and <a href=http://capturedtracks.com>Captured Tracks</a> are both labels that don't have very concrete identities. If you look at PPM, the difference between <a href=http://www.myspace.com/davidscottstone>Dave Scott Stone</a> and <a href=http://www.myspace.com/abevigoda>Abe Vigoda</a> is pretty wide. I'm happy to be on that label. I'm happy to not have expectations or like an identity that we have to channel in order to participate, and also to be a part of the level of creativity exhibited by the other artists on that label. Captured Tracks is really similar. I love the <a href=http://www.myspace.com/beachfossils>Beach Fossils</a> record but I also love <a href=http://www.myspace.com/teenagepanzerkorpsrules>TPK</a>. Bands that are very different from each other, but there's sort of a baseline of energy or creativity that exists in all the records. So I think for us it's rad to have that opportunity to do records with both those labels so there's not a defining identity or a specific preconceived perception. I think it's given us, what Aviram was saying, the opportunity to develop this next set of songs without worrying about how that will fit into the program.

<b>Would you say that there's like anything in particular that drives Silk Flowers?</b>

Aviram: I think we do a lot to foster our creative lives. We're all just interested in making music in and of itself. Not like what will occur to that. So we work a lot. We practice twice a week which is sorta a little bit more than average, or even more than necessary. We are all big fans of music, and think about music a lot, and think about sound, and it's sorta like we just do a lot in our individual lives to foster that and sort of carry on on a regular basis. I think it's the genuine interest in music in and of itself which is sorta like the backbone of it. Not so much worrying about what happens every step of the way or how it's perceived at all times.

Peter: It's kinda making room for everybody's interests too. I feel like we all come from a different musical place. Just like everybody. Everyone's got their own take on music. It's kinda like finding out what everybody wants to do and then figuring out how that equals whatever kinda music we wanna make. I feel like it's kinda a challenge and a really satisfying part of it: working everybody's influences into something.

Ethan: In a completely non-competitive way. I think the structure of the band is really kinda what drives it. It's like I get psyched on a drum loop that Aviram  will make then feel excited to match that or work with that. Or Peter will have a song structure that I feel excited to engage with. Like what Aviram was saying about practicing the amount that we practice. Life is hectic. I have long stretches of time where I feel like practice is the most exciting part. More so than shows or anything related to the band, but even just anything related to my life. That kinda window to just kinda work on a thing and be excited about it just for the sake of being in the room with two other people and being excited about it I think is where so much of the momentum for this band comes from. Really, it's been about two years since we started playing and it's kinda staggering to think of how much we've made in that two years. It's not a pace that I've ever worked at before in terms of writing songs, making records, playing shows.

<b>How did you get started, I read something about an art background?</b>

Peter:  There's some funny interviews where maybe we were joking around like, We all met in an art gallery. Which is kinda ridiculous, but it's not inaccurate. We do all exist in the art community.

Aviram: It's more accurate than the story that we all met in a butcher shop.

Peter: Right, we did not meet at a butcher stop. That's false information that we gave in an interview. I have no regrets. That was a good prank. But yeah, Avi and I worked together at an art gallery for a period of time. We didn't meet Ethan in the art world, but he does play a part in the art world in New York. We go to galleries together. We go to museums on tour sometimes. Anyway, Avi and I met at <a href=http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/>Metro Pictures</a>. We both worked there. I met Ethan on tour with a previous band I was in with Avi called <a href=http://www.myspace.com/soiledmattressandthesprings>Soiled Mattress and the Springs</a>. We played a show with Ethan's band at the time, Kisser, in Portland. Then Ethan moved to New York. What else happened?

Aviram: In the band with Peter I played drums and there were more acoustic instruments incorporated. But I'd always made little experimentations, more compositional based music, at home. I was looking to do a project similar to that, that implemented more electronic music hardware that I wasn't really adept to, but Ethan was. So I'd asked Ethan if he wanted to casually make music at home. What happened was Peter and I ended our other band because we decided we were more interested in playing electronic music. My solution to that was like he can join Ethan and I's project and help us develop it a bit more in terms of having a more song-based structure instead of more compositionally orientated pieces. Then we just like worked over the course of a summer. Wrote a couple songs and started playing them out. Recorded them. Released two singles in a few months.

<b>Are there ideas from what you've done artistically that tie in with how the band works?</b>

Ethan: I used to play music with this guy Brendan Fowler who does <a href=http://www.barrbarr.com/>Barr</a>. I was part of the live band version of Barr, but also he and I did an electronic band together called <a href=http://www.myspace.com/carclutch>Car Clutch</a>. I've been thinking about this a lot because I read an interview with him recently. He's kinda not so focussed on playing music right now because he has a visual, studio art career. In the interview he was talking about the difference between music and visual art and about how he kinda felt a limitation with performance and music because the structure is set up in a way where you can count on certain encounters or a certain series of events. He said what he liked about visual art is that it's sort of endless, the possibility of what you can claim under that umbrella. I appreciate why he feels that way, but I do think like that level of possibility and that sense of what you can engage, how you can have a question you wanna ask and like engage a dialogue or start a dialogue about it, I think that's been the biggest thing about my daily participation through my job in the art world. I recognise that there are lots of ways to do that. Definitely playing in this band has been the most valid way for me to do that. More than any other form of communication that I have. I really am able to kinda process things and kinda create a dialogue. Ask a question out loud so that I don't have to answer, but somebody can answer it. I think that that's what the band does for me in a lot of ways. I definitely needed that relationship with the art world to understand that that was OK.

Peter: I really like the collaborative process in the music world. You can obviously have that in any world that you exist in if you want it. But it seems to come more naturally in my life situation in the music world. I think it's really valuable. I kinda like how coming up with music is sorta like you don't need to even necessarily start with a conceptual structure. I guess that's the same as art. You could start with a sketch or drawing or whatever. I like the intuitive nature of music. You can have that in any creative world, but I just sort of feel it more in the music world.

<b>Do you think there's an ideal target for where you want Silk Flowers to be?</b>

Aviram:  Going back to the art question, I think, based on the two of their answers, we all consider it as an art form in an of itself, but to me art is really like a form of communication so I think I just wanna extend or expand that possibility. I don't think we worry about it so much. I think that that's important. That's sorta what keeps it going. We get along very well at this point, and we're happy with what we're doing, and we just wanna like see it keep going the way it's been going. Every time a certain facet of being a band comes around again, like this is our second European tour, it's much easier than the previous one. It wasn't like that the first time around it'd be a negative experience, but now it's just like a more heightened positive experience. I think in those terms, the way I see the band, or what I hope for for the band, is just to keep going with that and just like each thing gets like a little bit easier, and just like a little bit broader. Communicating with people who are interested in what we're doing. Just like having a good time, because if you're not doing that then it's just like an awful amount of time to not be enjoying yourself.
