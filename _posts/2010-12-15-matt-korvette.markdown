<b>What attracts you to writing songs about loners?</b>

I don't particularly try to write about loners, I generally write about things that affect me personally and privately. Some of the thoughts I have when alone are pretty relatable.

<b>Do you often encounter expectations about the band that you fail to meet?</b>

I have never pissed my jeans on stage, and I am pretty sure that has left a few people disappointed. They need to get over it.

<b>What's the relationship between punk and Pissed Jeans?</b>

I like to think that I live my life how I want, and don't just fall into some pre-programmed stereotype, but at the same time, I'm a pretty normal person. We all came from the loud & fast rules dictum of hardcore punk. Recently we played a show with Negative Approach. They were raw and great. Just as I hoped.

<b>What's the worst show you've ever played?</b>

We played in Columbus, Ohio to a small disinterested crowd on the night of a big Ohio State football game and it stunk. Even that wasn't so bad, really.

<b>Was it pretty important to you to get a lot of girls in your new video?</b>

Women dancing with the band was basically the central theme, so yes. I definitely want to make Pissed Jeans a thing that women can enjoy, since they are undeniably the superior gender.

<b>How do you see the future for Pissed Jeans?</b>

Have fun, be cool, enjoy life, that's it really. Pissed Jeans are already far more successful than I could've ever hoped. I don't see it changing drastically, but I hope we do continue to change and evolve. I think it's safe to say we will always be pretty loud and rocking.
