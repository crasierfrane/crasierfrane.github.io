<b>Got any good stories from tour?</b>

Nick: We saw a guy do a shit on the Paris metro.

Lucy: The best part about it is that he was wiping his bum.

Matthew: A man came to a show the other night with a taxidermied dog. It looked like a rottweiler or something.

Lucky: He said he'd give me a joint but then he just started punishing me with his poems. He was a cockney poet.

Lucy: We played in Switzerland at a place called Bad Bonn, in a small town in the middle of nowhere. That was pretty cool. It was just like we were playing in this really small town and the guy just gets in people who he'd like to play. We played in a train carriage in Stuttgart, called the wagon. That was really fun. We played in a a squatted social centre in milan. That was really good. There was a dancehall rave going on and we were sleeping upstairs in a children's hospital. I think it'd been there since the 70s.

<b>What's the experience of touring like in Australia compared to the rest of the world?</b>

Lucy: It's very different because in Australia the distances are so far. To play a show between Sydney and Melbourne is a 10 hour drive and there's nowhere really to play between them, like you could play Canberra, but we haven't played there much. We often fly between shows. You can drive and we do sometimes, but it costs about the same when you consider petrol and hire. I think mostly you will like book a show yourself in Australia. You'll contact the venue and stuff. It's pretty different from Europe, where there's a promoter in each place you go to. We get that in Sydney and stuff but not so much.

<b>Where do bands usually first tour after Australia?</b>

Matthew: Nowhere. You stay there and watch TV.

Lucy: Everyone's different I think. Our friends in Circle Pit are just about to tour America for the first time. Whereas other friends bands have gone to Japan. Our first tour overseas was in America. It's funny, New Zealand's so close to Australia but we've never played there.

Matthew: We haven't even played in Perth, which is in Australia, but on the other side.

<b>Would you say the band takes a lot of cultural references from Australia/Goth?</b>

Lucy: I think yeah definitely. I think it's hard to know how conscious it is. I do like a lot of Australian bands, but at the same time it's hard to know exactly how much of a direct influence that is, or being in Australia is.

Nick: It is a pretty particular environment because it's like a Western country completely separate from the Western world.

Matthew: I guess we all like a lot of Australian music, but when you meet a band or something like an American/European group, they'll talk about what they like or what they see in the music and you're like, Eugh. There is a very different perspective. I've even found that on this tour. People talk about this band almost as if they like an aspect of it that's different. It's hard to say what it is. They'll be like, I like the way it's this and this. And you're like I've never thought about that. Yeah, I think there's some sort of Australian weird punk thing that exists again and still exists in our music. I think we all like that.

Nick: The punk attitude in Australia is different to that in America or Europe.

<b>What would you say the punk attitude in Australia is?</b>

Nick: Australian bands have a weird like tragic, self-effacing sense of humour. I think definitely all the bands I like in Australia don't take their music that seriously. Well, they take it seriously but they have a sense of humour about it.

Lucy: Yeah, I think Australians aren't afraid to make the kind of music that's a bit more melancholy. Maybe it's the same in the UK.  Not even melancholy, more a desperation sometimes in Australian music. It seems like in American music they want to be a bit more about having good times. I love all these generalisations.

Matthew: Maybe we like indulge it to the point that it becomes a good thing.

Nick: It's weird because we get as much British Culture as we do American culture in Australia. Where as Britain and America are maybe a bit more cut off from each other in terms of music or comedy or whatever. Australia gets both. It's a bizarre blend.

<b>Do you feel like you often encounter particular expectations?</b>

Matthew: I feel like if there are then we're pretty good at like letting them down.

Lucy: I guess I really don't know how people see our band. In Brighton after the show a guy was like, Oh, I thought it was gonna be more punishing than that. That was really good. Maybe because we've changed our sound a bit. We used to be a 2 piece and we were more harsh, now it's a bit more crowd pleasing. In a weird way. Stadium-goth. In America the room would empty on our last tour. There'd be a dedicated dude up the front looking really really into it. Now people stay in the room a bit more. We've softened it. I don't think our band has enough of a mystique around it for us to know what people's expectations are.

<b>So what is the history of the band?</b>

Matthew: We started 5 or 6 years ago then about a year and a half ago we sorta got to the point where we wanted it to be more of a different instrumentation with songs done a bit differently. We have one LP which is a collection of the early stuff. It summed up the first few years, the different styles. It's more keyboards, bass, drum machine. Very different. Then we as a band did another album earlier this year which is more kinda like what it is now. It's hard to tell how different they are. It just began because we wanted to start a band. We hadn't really been in other bands. I was kind of but we just sorta started with us sticking to a formula and just kinda trying to make up song. I feel like that's kinda the theme.

<b>It seems like it must be pretty hard for DIY bands to make it over to Australia. Do many bands come out?</b>

Lucy: I think it is hard, yeah. It depends. I think a lot of bands who do come out mostly have an Australian promoter paying for them to come out.

Lucky: A lot of Eurpoean punk bands have come out in the past few years and lost a lot of money. Punks have different expectations though I guess. To me it seems like more and more bands are coming over.

Matthew: I think there's starting to be more and more, because in Australia maybe 10 years ago there wasn't much . There weren't many festivals. There were big festivals but there were just a few a year. Now it seems like there are more and more. And more are starting to bring bands that aren't so mainstream. That's a good way for a band to come over. Thee Oh Sees, they came out and played the Meredith festival. I suppose they're quite a big band in the US. It's just like the flight that's a huge deal. Once you're there you can kinda probably do a few good shows and make your way around.

Lucky: Maybe 10 years ago no DIY bands would come out. So being a kid growing up you wouldn't see them. Now it seems like there's always a show. There are heaps. A lot of the shows we do are international supports.

<b>Have you had any funny descriptions in the press?</b>

Matthew: We've been build as Ozzy-Goth. Which is kinda fine but we're not gonna start using it. We've had a couple of reviews where they were obviously intended to be bad but they made us sound good. There was one that said we were like music stuck in David Lynch's head. There was another one that said something like, It sounds like Teenage Jesus and the Jerks on Tamazepan. I was like, That sounds good. Then there was one that was like, Your little sister's band.

Lucky: Throbbing Gristle minus the freakshow.
