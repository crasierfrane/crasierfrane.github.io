<b>What does it feel like being elevated to a legendary status over time to the point that you're a cult hero to a lot of people?</b>

I don't really pay attention to anything like that. I don't think anyone thinks I am legendary or anything. I certainly don't deserve anything like that.

<b>Does it feel to you like the creative climate is different now from how it was in the early 80s? Like do you think Black Flag or some equivalent could happen tomorrow?</b>

I think those days were different than what's happening now as things were a bit more uncharted. There were a lot of rough areas out there where now things are an eight lane highway by comparison. I think Black Flag had at least one ingredient they only made one of and that's Greg Ginn, that's the big deal with that band.

<b>How did you make the move into shows that are just you talking? Did you have to practice or was it a case of just doing it?</b>

There's really nothing to practice. I do think things through and run things in my head but I just go out every night and hit it. I guess every night is practice for the next night.

<b>Do you wish more artists you like would do it, maybe so you could get a bit more insight into them?</b>

I only want people to do what they want. I don't know if all of those people would necessarily be all that interesting. Just because someone writes good songs, doesn't mean they are someone you want to hear speak. I know some very great songwriters who can't form a sentence without putting you to sleep.

<b>Do you have any role models in that area of your work? Who's your favourite?</b>

I draw a lot of inspiration from Lenny Bruce. Past that, there are a lot of people who are/were very great onstage. Carlin, Pryor, Hicks, X, Obama, there's a ton of great speakers.

<b>So you just got back from Indonesia. What kinda stuff were you doing out there? Was it travelling or charity or something else?</b>

I am in Bangladesh now. I am out on my own for two months, all over the world. Indonesia was interesting, a lot of poverty but friendly people. I have been all over the place, just wandering around in strange neighborhoods.

<b>Are the USO tours a pretty important thing for you? How come?</b>

They are definitely important. I think it's important for soldiers to have multiple ways to stay connected with the world, they can get really cut loose from planet earth. One of the best things is to be able to make some of these people laugh.

<b>It seems like a big part of your writing style is observing average people, and making something poetic out of that. Do you think that comes from punk?</b>

I think it comes from basic curiosity. I know that punk rock is supposedly the music of the real people or whatever but “real” people drink beer and watch NASCAR. Many of the people who made the great punk rock songs were anything but average. None of my very average schoolmates liked punk music. They thought it was gay, actually.
