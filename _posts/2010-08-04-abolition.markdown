<b>How's tour going?</b>

Nick: We left yesterday on the 24th. We played in Peterborough. Then we drove 8 hours to get here today and that's it so far. We're gonna be playing a few more dates in the UK then on the 29th we're going to Ireland for two days and going back on the first of August. It's our first tour and it's been real fun so far. It's been the craziest thing ever.

<b>How long have you guys been going for?</b>

Nick: I'd say we started early 2009.  At first things were really slow but lately things have picked up. We just done two records, We done a split with our friends in <a href=http://www.myspace.com/hangthebastardlondon>Hang the Bastard</a> and we've just put out our own 7 on <a href=http://ctwrecords.com/>Carry The Weight Records</a>. So yeah things are picking up a bit. It's looking cool.

<b>Personally, how did you get into straight edge and punk and stuff?</b>

Nick: So I guess I properly became involved in hardcore when I was around 14/15 years old. I learnt about straight edge through that. I started calling myself straight edge when I was maybe 15/16. At first perhaps I didn't really have a clear understanding of what it was, but I'd say in recent years I've come to realise how much of a rejection of mainstream culture it is. Just like the fucking mindless escapism you see ever day. Shit like that.

Jimmy: First year of college when all of our friends were like smoking and shit, slowly all the college kids smoked. It was the cool thing to do. And it's like, What are you doing? It's bad for you. It's gonna kill you and shit. Everyone's like, Ah, nah. I'm smoking like its well cool like. I'm like, Nah, fuck that. I don't wanna die. Just like, so many kids they go out and they get drunk and then they like fuck about and they get sick and end up in an ambulance. They think they're having so much fun but they're not remembering what they're doing. A cigarette man and a booze man are sitting in their factory and they're all buying their cigarettes. They're addicted to the shit.  They're not thinking, I'm addicted to this shit it's gonna kill me. They're going on and smoking and drinking and don't think what's behind it. They're giving their money to someone who's basically killing them.

<b>How do you feel about the way most shows essentially fund drinks companies?</b>

Charlie: I think that's what the DIY aspect is for. To just bypass that kind of thing. Playing a front room is a lot more punk than playing a bar or whatever. The people that own the bar only really think of the money that they're gonna make off the bands, but in a front room everyone's gonna be there because they love the music.

Jimmy: I understand though that not every time you're gonna be able to play in a house or like a DIY space. In London there's very few DIY venues.

Charlie: Due to gentrification London has been almost destroyed entirely of squats. Most of the social centres have been shut down so it's hard for us to play entirely DIY spaces.

Jimmy: A lot of the time bands are charging a lot for petrol so they have to put it in a bigger space to try to get more people in. I think people need to just appreciate playing shows in these spaces. You have to get petrol money but surely you should save up for that shit before you go.
