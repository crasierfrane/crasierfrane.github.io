<b>What's the story of Night Birds?</b>

The Ergs! played a show with Brian's old band, For Science. Brian was wearing an Adolescents shirt (the blue one) and I remember thinking I'd like to start a band with someone else who likes The Adolescents. We got together with a couple of the guys from local NJ legends The Degenerics and started working on some stuff that became the early Night Birds songs.

The band sort of fizzled out before we could play or record anything, but once The Ergs! broke up I thought we should reform with Mike on guitar. He was the obvious choice. His style is perfect and his knowledge of surf music is what I would (but I'm sure he would not) call encyclopedic.

<b>Do you enjoy working with genres like surf/country where there's pretty defined stylistic rules?</b>

Yeah, but only because I'm not a good enough songwriter to dump all the rules and make my own. I start with the rules and deviate from there. I don't think there are too many associated with surf music though. Pretty much the only one is that you have to either have the awash-in-reverb surf guitar sound or be based around the Beach Boys-type melody/harmony thing. It's pretty obvious which route we took.

<b>When did you start playing bass?</b>

I think I was around 15.

<b>Who were some earlier influences on your playing?</b>

I've always ripped off Karl Alvarez of Descendents/All pretty hard. When I first started playing bass, his lines were the ones I would try to learn.

<b>What do you think draws you to that instrument?</b>

I hate to have the stereotypical garage band reason for playing bass, but the truth is I made friends with the punk kids in high school and they all already played instruments decently. I wanted to play music with them so I picked bass because it had the fewest strings and seemed to require the least amount of time to get competent at.

<b>How have the Ergs reunion shows been?</b>

They were fun. We raised a lot of money and by all accounts we didn't stink the joint out or anything. I didn't know if I was going to enjoy them before I got up there, but I had a blast. It feels way different. It's not an active band and each of us has moved on in a lot of ways. At the earlier shows we did, the crowd was mostly younger kids who had never seen us before that day.

<b>How come you guys called it a day?</b>

Jeff didn't want to do it anymore. We always had a rule that if anyone left the band it was over.

<b>Did it feel weird to end a high school band after such a long time?</b>

Yeah, it was a big life change. It's like going out with the same girl since the beginning of high school, calling it off after 10 years, and then entering the dating scene for the first time. In a lot of ways, you don't get out of that high school, teenage mentality until you move on and can look back on it with some perspective.
