<b>How's tour going?</b>

Honour: It's fucking nuts man. Paris was nuts. Tonight was nuts. The show before this one was nuts. Trash Talk have been getting buck. It's been dangerous. Drugs, girls, debauchery. We smoked a lot of grass. Couple of fights. Sketchy situations. Kicked out of bars. Same old story.

Jason: It's been the shit. Trash Talk have been our homies for a while now and we got to put this tour together. Us and them feeding off each other's energy and going in together every night has been a blast. Kids going crazy all across Europe. Different places, different faces. All of them having fun. It's been a blast.

<b>What's the best show you've played?</b>

Honour: Ballzy holds it down everywhere we go homie.

<b>What's the worst show you've played?</b>

Honour: One time Mason fell off stage at an empty show and cracked his face open. I dunno. Sometimes you get into fights.

Jason: I guess that's technically a bad show.

<b>Where do you get in the most fights?</b>

Honour: Lord knows, man. It's not up to the crowd really it's mostly us. If we're feeling weird that day then shit just gets sketchy.

<b>What was it like growing up in New York?</b>

Honour: Growing up in New York is like nothing else. Like growing up where anyone grows up. It's just your home town. What can you do? Fast. Fun.

<b>Are there particular musical influences from that city that you feel are important to Cerebral Ballzy?</b>

Honour: Definitely the CBGBs crew of bands were a big influence on us. There are a lot bands from there that we just admire. Whether it be the Ramones or the Dead Boys, two of my favourite bands, or Bad Brains, which is CBGB shit at least.

<b>Why do you think so many big publications caught onto you guys?</b>

Jason: I don't have a fucking clue man. We're just out there doing what we're doing. If people get interested then all we can be is stoked.

Honour: A lot of kids can relate to pizza, beer, and partying. Also a lot of girls like us cuz we're hot.

<b>What are your plans in terms of recordings?</b>

Honour: We're finishing up an album right now. We're working on another EP. Hopefully by summer our album will be out for everyone to hear it. We're super stoked. Our 7 came out on the 25th November. Go get it. Pettibon did the artwork.

<b>How did you get that connection with him?</b>

Honour: Pettibon's a good friend. We started hanging out a tonne. He was painting and I was like, I love that, so he gave it to me and we used it.

<b>Do you have any advice to finish with?</b>

Honour: Go do what you want. Be smart about your actions, but always do what you want. Don't let anyone alter what you think is right. Besides somebody thatâ€¦y'know. You know what I'm saying. Be true to yourself. Be true to your school [laughs], just like you would to your girl or your boy.
